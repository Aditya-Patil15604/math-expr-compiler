# math-expr-compiler

A simple program that converts mathematical expressions into an assembly-like language.

## Description
This project takes basic mathematical expressions as input, tokenizes and parses them, and generates corresponding assembly-style instructions. It is intended as a learning project to understand the basics of compilers such as lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation.

## Features
- Supports basic arithmetic expressions
- Tokenizer and parser implementation
- Generates simple assembly-like output

## Build
```bash
make
```

## To run the program
```bash
make run
```
